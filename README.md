## Getting To Know Slush

[Slush](https://github.com/klei/slush) is a tool that uses [Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp) for project scaffolding.

Slush does not contain anything "out of the box", except the ability to locate installed slush generators and to run them with [liftoff](https://github.com/tkellen/node-liftoff).

To find out more about Slush, check out the [documentation](https://github.com/klei/slush).
