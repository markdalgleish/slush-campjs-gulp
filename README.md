## Getting To Know Slush

[Slush](https://github.com/klei/slush) is a tool that uses [Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp) for project scaffolding.

Slush does not contain anything "out of the box", except the ability to locate installed slush generators and to run them with liftoff.

To find out more about Slush, check out the [documentation](https://github.com/klei/slush).
